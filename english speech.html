I am Shifa from class VIII here to deliver a speech on 'Effects of pollution on young generation' Pollution has become one of the most concerning issues for our planet and mankind, Pollution is responsible for distributing the balance of the ecosystem, Moreover, it impacts our lifestyle severely and also contributes greatly to global warming which leads to Climate change. As the world is getting more modern, pollution is also enhancing day by day. It’s like we are the sufferers of our own creations. The fact that the rate of deforestation is more than the rate of afforestation is enough for the young generation to be scared of the future. Every day around 93% of the world’s children under the age of 15 years (1.8 billion children) breathe air that is so polluted it puts their health and development at serious risk. Tragically, many of them die, WHO estimates that in 2016, 600,000 children died from acute lower respiratory infections caused by polluted air. A report by United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) shows that every fifth child in the world is affected by the lack of availability of clean water, Water is polluted hence resulting in the consumption of polluted water, due to the consumption of polluted water more than 700 children die due to diarrhea every day. To solve the crisis of Pollution we have to work hand in hand and not as one state or one country or one Government. Blaming the government will not be beneficial if we as individuals are not responsible enough to adhere to the norms issued by the government in order to reduce the level of pollution. If we won't start working from now on, then in the future we might have a lockdown because of pollution, our parents will die of old age but we as a generation will die of climate change if proper action won’t be taken by us .Thank you all for listening to my speech, hope all liked and agreed to the points stated, Have a great day ahead!</p> <p>This paragraph has been written by - Tamanna Patra                                                                Class -  8/2                                                               Roll No - 35                                                                Group - 7 - Sreeshant Pradhan, Roll No - 32,                                                                                    Subham Bhattacharjee, Roll No - 33,                                                                                    Swapnil Ghosh, Roll No - 34,                                                                                    Tamanna Patra, Roll No - 35</p>
