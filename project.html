I am Shifa from class VIII here to deliver a speech on 'Effects of pollution on young generation' </p>            <p>Pollution has become one of the most concerning issues for our planet and mankind, Pollution is responsible for distributing the balance of the ecosystem, Moreover, it impacts our lifestyle severely and also contributes greatly to global warming which leads to Climate change. As the world is getting more modern, pollution is also enhancing day by day. It’s like we are the sufferers of our own creations. The fact that the rate of deforestation is more than the rate of afforestation is enough for the young generation to be scared of the future. Every day around 93% of the world’s children under the age of 15 years (1.8 billion children) breathe air that is so polluted it puts their health and development at serious risk. Tragically, many of them die, WHO estimates that in 2016, 600,000 children died from acute lower respiratory infections caused by polluted air. A report by United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF) shows that every fifth child in the world is affected by the lack of availability of clean water, Water is polluted hence resulting in the consumption of polluted water, due to the consumption of polluted water more than 700 children die due to diarrhea every day. To solve the crisis of Pollution we have to work hand in hand and not as one state or one country or one Government. Blaming the government will not be beneficial if we as individuals are not responsible enough to adhere to the norms issued by the government in order to reduce the level of pollution. If we won't start working from now on, then in the future we might have a lockdown because of pollution, our parents will die of old age but we as a generation will die of climate change if proper action won’t be taken by us.</p><p>Thank you all for listening to my speech, hope all liked and agreed to the points stated, Have a great day ahead!</p> <h2><font color="maroon"> What is Pollution ?</h2><p> Pollution,The presence of harmful substances in the air, land, and water, which can have an adverse effect on living beings and on the environment is pollution. </p><h3> Major types of Pollution - </h3><p><font color="maroon"> Land Pollution -     Land gets polluted due to household and industrial waste.</p>  <p>Water pollution -     Water pollution happens when chemicals or dangerous foreign substances are introduced to    water, including chemicals, sewage, pesticides and fertilizers from agricultural runoff, or metals like lead or mercury.</p>    <p>Air Pollution -     The air we breathe has a very exact chemical composition; 99% of it is made up of nitrogen, oxygen, water vapor and inert gases.     Air pollution occurs when things that aren't  normally there are added to the air.     A common type of air pollution happens when people release particles into the air from burning fuels.                                                                   This pollution looks like soot, containing millions of tiny particles, floating in the air.</p>         <p>Noise pollution -     Even though humans can't see or smell noise pollution, it still affects the environment.    Noise pollution happens when the sound coming from planes, industry or other sources reaches harmful levels.</p><h4><font color="darkblue"> MATHS PROJECT - </h4><p><font color="DeepPink">1) Pie Chart Depicting Industries in kolkata from year 2014 to 2019 - </p><p><img src="C:\Users\Sushil Patra\OneDrive\Pictures\Screenshots\INDUSTRIES IN KOLKATA.png"></p><p><font color="DeepPink">2) Pie Chart depicting Pollution in kolkata from year 2014 to 2019 - </p><p><img src="C:\Users\Sushil Patra\OneDrive\Pictures\Screenshots\POLLUTION IN KOLKATA.png"></p><p><font color="DeepPink">3) Line graph depicting Pollution in Kolkata from year 2005 to 2010 - </p><img src="C:\Users\Sushil Patra\OneDrive\Pictures\Screenshots\POLLUTION(LINE GRPAH).png"><h5><font color="Yellowgreen"> CREDITS - </h5><p><font color="DarkSlateGrey"> Whole webpage has been made by Tamanna Patra, Roll No - 35{English & Science Part} </p> <p> Pie charts have been made by Shubham Bhattarcharjee, Roll No - 33 </p><p> Line graph has been made by Swapnil Ghosh, Roll no - 34</p><p> Hindi project (which won't be included in webpage as per previous instructions) has been made by Sreeshant Pradhan, Roll no - 32</p><h6>GROUP 7 - </h6><p>Sreeshant Pradhan, Roll no - 32</p><p>Subham Bhattacharjee, Roll no - 33</p><p>Swapnil Ghosh, Roll no - 34</p><p>Tamanna Patra, Roll no - 35</p><p> Please note Tanisha is not in group 7, she is group 8</p> <h7>THANK YOU!</h7>
